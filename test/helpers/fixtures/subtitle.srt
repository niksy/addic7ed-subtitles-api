South.

00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:23,354
What are you gonna do?

10
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,189
Get warm.

11
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:34,749
I was with you
at Hardhome.

12
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:38,369
We saw
what's out there.

13
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,871
We know
it's coming here.

14
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:42,373
How can you
leave us now?

15
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,009
I did everything I could.
You know that.

16
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,343
You swore a vow.

17
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,367
Aye, I pledged my life
to the Night's Watch.

18
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,431
- I gave my life.
- For all nights to come.

19
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,967
They killed me, Edd!
My own brothers.

20
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,936
You want me
to stay here after that?

24
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,320
This is good soup.

25
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,959
Do you remember those kidney pies
Old Nan used to make?

26
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:44,629
- With the peas and onions?
- Mmm.

27
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,251
We never should
have left Winterfell.

28
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:53,137
Don't you wish we could
go back to the day we left?

29
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,809
I want to scream at myself,
"Don't go, you idiot."

30
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:00,978
How could we know?

31
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:05,182
I spent a lot of time thinking about
what an ass I was to you.

32
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,186
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>change everything.</i>

33
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:10,438
We were children.

34
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,156
I was awful,
just admit it.

35
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,275
( chuckles )

36
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,744
You were
occasionally awful.

37
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:18,663
I'm sure I can't
have been great fun.

38
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:21,532
Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

39
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:23,451
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

40
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,536
- Forgive me.
- All right.

41
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,672
All right,
I forgive you.

42
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,624
( laughs )

43
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,354
- ( coughing )
- ( laughs )

44
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,857
You'd think after
thousands of years,

45
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:49,527
the Night's Watch would have learned
how to make a good ale.

46
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,231
Where will you go?

47
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:58,569
Where will <i>we</i> go?

48
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,807
If I don't watch over you,

49
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:01,653
Father's ghost will come
back and murder me.

50
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,377
Where will we go?

51
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,963
I can't stay here,
not after what happened.

52
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,082
<i>There's only one place</i>
<i>we can go.</i>

53
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,300
Home.

54
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,637
Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

55
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,389
We'll take it back
from them.

56
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:22,810
I don't have an army.

57
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,012
How many wildlings
did you save?

58
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,731
They didn't come here
to serve me.

59
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,100
They owe you
their lives.

60
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:32,353
You think they'll be safe here if
Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

61
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:34,822
- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

62
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:38,442
It's ours and Arya's
and Bran's and Rickon's.

63
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,661
Wherever they are,
it belongs to our family.

64
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,113
We have to fight for it.

65
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:44,331
I'm tired of fighting.

66
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,120
It's all I've done
since I left home.

67
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,122
I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.

68
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,924
I've killed wildlings.
I've killed men that I admire.

69
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,461
I hanged a boy
younger than Bran.

70
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:04,301
I fought and I lost.

71
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:11,642
If we don't take back the North,
we'll never be safe.

72
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,529
I want you to help me.

73
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,650
But I'll do it myself
if I have to.

74
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:24,872
My lady.

75
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,575
Ser Davos.

76
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,580
Will you stay here
at Castle Black?

77
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:36,417
I will do
as Jon Snow commands.

78
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:38,335
You serve Jon Snow now?

79
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,722
He's the prince
that was promised.

80
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,227
Forgive me, my lady, I thought
that was Stannis.

81
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:58,322
What happened
down there?

82
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:03,577
There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

83
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,698
And Shireen?

84
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,366
What happened
to the princess?

85
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:12,169
I saw what happened.

86
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:15,089
I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

87
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,091
My lady,
I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

88
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,793
We've met before.

89
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:20,628
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

90
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:24,882
Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.

91
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:27,685
That's in the past now.

92
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,971
Yes, it's in the past.

93
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,607
It doesn't mean
I forget.

94
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:36,694
Or forgive.

95
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,197
He admitted it,
you know.

96
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:42,066
Who did?

97
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,235
Stannis.

98
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,487
Just before
I executed him.

99
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,150
( sighs )

100
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,937
<i>( horses approaching )</i>

101
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,241
( horse whinnies )

102
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,451
The Defender of the Vale!

103
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,203
Uncle Petyr!

104
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,678
My lord.

105
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,347
Come and see.

106
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:49,099
I missed your name day.
Go on.

107
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:53,470
- ( screeches )
- ( gasps ) A falcon!

108
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:54,972
A gyrfalcon.

109
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:56,523
The greatest and rarest
of birds.

110
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:59,310
Last time
I saw you, Baelish,

111
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:03,647
you told me you were taking
Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.

112
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,982
Indeed I was.

113
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,318
And yet not long ago,
we received reports

114
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:10,487
that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

115
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:11,680
On our way to the Fingers,

116
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,027
we were set upon by a large
force of Bolton men.

117
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:16,056
Seemed to know exactly when

118
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,397
we were traveling and exactly
whom we were transporting.

119
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,547
Do you take me
for a fool?

120
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,500
Tell me, Lord Royce,

121
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:27,004
how many people knew
of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?

122
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,391
I shared my intentions
with you

123
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,643
<i>and no one else.</i>

124
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:36,513
Slander a man
in his own home,

125
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,400
you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

126
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:44,154
Your home is the Vale.
The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

127
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,024
And only his judgment
concerns me.

128
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:55,115
Robin: <i>Shall we throw him</i>
<i>through the Moon Door?</i>

129
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,291
My lord.

130
00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:08,963
My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.

131
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:12,049
To your father, to your mother,
and now to you.

132
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,635
Do you believe him,
Uncle Petyr?

133
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,641
( screeches )

134
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:26,063
Lord Royce has served
the Vale well.

135
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:29,900
He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

136
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:33,537
If we could trust
his absolute loyalty,

137
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:36,206
he would make a capable commander
in the wars to come.

138
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:43,297
You can trust my absolute loyalty,
my lord.

139
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,216
I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

140
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,808
Fine.

141
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:04,351
I bring good news.

142
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,021
My friends in the North
tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

143
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,906
I expect she's headed
to Castle Black

144
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:11,325
where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.

145
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:15,612
But she won't be safe there,
not with the Boltons after her.

146
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,581
( sighs )

147
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,533
She's my cousin.

148
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:23,370
We should help her.

149
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:26,123
That was my instinct
as well.

150
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:28,792
Our lord has spoken.

151
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:32,296
Gather the Knights
of the Vale.

152
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:35,466
The time has come
to join the fray.

153
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,603
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

154
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:41,805
Grey Worm: <i>You invite the enemy</i>
<i>into our city?</i>

155
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,607
I did.

156
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,143
As a clever man
once told me,

157
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,946
"We make peace with our enemies,
not our friends."

158
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:51,982
Grey Worm: I don't make peace
with the queen's enemies.

159
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:53,200
I kill
the queen's enemies.

160
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,785
Yes, that's
the military approach.

161
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,453
And how has that worked
here in Meereen?

162
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,822
I represent
the diplomatic approach.

163
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,075
Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters

164
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
and they tried
to murder her.

165
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:06,163
We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

166
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:09,583
Trust me. My own recent
experience with slavery

167
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,585
has taught me the horrors
of that institution.

168
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,087
How many days
were you a slave?

169
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,172
( stammers )
Long enough to know.

170
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:18,308
Not long enough
to understand.

171
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:28,352
I bought this dwarf
for a single gold honor.

172
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,521
And somehow you've risen

173
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,524
to the top of the
Great Pyramid of Meereen.

174
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,442
It's most impressive.

175
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:38,362
And now you speak
for the Good Masters of Astapor.

176
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:40,831
Here's to reversals
of fortune.

177
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,499
We came here
to meet the queen

178
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:45,002
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

179
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,872
Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

180
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,925
We want you to leave
Slaver's Bay.

181
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:55,712
Take your dragons
and your mercenaries and go.

182
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:58,382
Queen Daenerys won't stay
in Meereen forever.

183
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:00,267
Her path takes
her westward.

184
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,719
When we last met,
I offered her ships

185
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:06,690
so she could return to Westeros
where she belongs. She refused them.

186
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:08,892
She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

187
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,944
of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

188
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,480
As they have
since the dawn of time.

189
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,733
- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

190
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,702
You still follow orders.

191
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,321
Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

192
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:23,157
doesn't mean
she's not a master.

193
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:26,710
Friends, friends,
friends, please.

194
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,211
There have always been

195
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,163
those with wealth and power
and those with nothing.

196
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,513
That is the way of the world.

197
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,537
I'm not here to change
the way of the world.

198
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:37,004
Slavery is the way
of our world.

199
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,591
You don't need slaves
to make money.

200
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:43,560
There haven't been slaves in Westeros
for hundreds of years

201
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,596
and I grew up richer
than any of you.

202
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,268
But our queen recognizes
that she erred

203
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:54,021
by abolishing slavery

204
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,940
without providing
a new system to replace it.

205
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:00,827
So here
is the queen's proposal.

206
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:03,780
Slavery will never
return to Meereen,

207
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,617
but she will give
the other cities of Slaver's Bay

208
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,702
time to adjust
to the new order.

209
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,120
What does that mean?

210
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:13,340
Instead of abolishing
slavery overnight,

211
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,176
we will give you seven years
to end the practice.

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,133
Slaveholders
will be compensated

213
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,969
for their losses,
of course, at fair prices.

214
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,555
In exchange,
you will cut off

215
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,390
your support for
the Sons of the Harpy.

216
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,036
We do not support
the Sons of the Harpy.

217
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:35,195
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

218
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:39,316
I do hope you accept,
my friends.

219
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,318
You will not receive
a better offer.

220
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:44,655
( rings bell )

221
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,624
Let us sail
on the tide of freedom

222
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,960
instead of being
drowned by it.

223
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,414
And as a parting gift
to our honored guests...

224
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:05,175
Give freedom a chance.

225
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:08,645
See if it doesn't taste every bit as good
as what came before.

226
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,188
( whispering in Valyrian )

227
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:19,525
( Tyrion speaking Valyrian )

228
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,485
_

229
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,316
_

230
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,152
_

231
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:31,585
Perhaps I should
translate for you.

232
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,287
Man: <i>We speak</i>
<i>the Common Tongue.</i>

233
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,873
- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.

234
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,375
Tyrion:
<i>I did.</i>

235
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

236
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:43,714
<i>Now you invite them</i>
<i>to our city and drink wine with them.</i>

237
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,803
I imagine
this room was built

238
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:52,939
so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

239
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,810
But I am not your ruler.

240
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,229
I'm not
the Breaker of Chains.

241
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,481
I'm not the Unburnt.

242
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:05,786
And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

243
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:07,904
You are a stranger here.

244
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,957
So why do you represent
Meereen in these talks with our enemies?

245
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:14,494
Because our queen
chose me as her advisor.

246
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,713
Until she returns
from her travels--

247
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,298
When does she return?

248
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,834
Soon.
You have my word.

249
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,588
We don't know you. We don't trust you.
We know Torgo Nudho.

250
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:26,640
We fight with him
against the Masters. We trust him.

251
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,594
And that is exactly why Grey Worm
took part in these negotiations.

252
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,314
<i>As commander of the Unsullied,</i>
<i>he knows how to defeat the slavers</i>

253
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,149
and he knows when
it is time to make peace.

254
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,102
You have made peace
with the slavers?

255
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,584
Tyrion:
<i>We offered terms.</i>

256
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:41,585
( speaking Valyrian )

257
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:42,566
_

258
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,625
_

259
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:49,714
_

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,264
_

261
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:00,426
_

262
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,329
_

263
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:03,908
_

264
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:06,509
_

265
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:10,731
_

266
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:14,174
_

267
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:22,185
_

268
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:28,708
_

269
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,460
- Do not use me for your lies.
- Those men respect you.

270
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,829
They respect me
because they know who I am.

271
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,964
- They know I am loyal.
- As do I.

272
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,333
I am loyal to my queen,
not you.

273
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,302
If you betray her work,
you are my enemy.

274
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,505
I am not betraying her work.
I am trying to save her city.

275
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,057
You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

276
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:52,342
For a short time.

277
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:55,178
Seven years is not a short time
for a slave.

278
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:56,763
You're right.

279
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:59,316
Slavery is a horror
that should be ended at once.

280
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,935
War is a horror that should be ended
at once.

281
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,687
I can't do both today.

282
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:05,238
You are wrong
to trust these men.

283
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,775
I don't trust the Masters.
I trust their self-interest.

284
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:10,527
They're trustworthy
if they're convinced

285
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:12,829
that working with me
is in their self-interest.

286
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:15,782
You don't know them.
You don't understand them.

287
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,534
We are not human
in their eyes.

288
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,920
They look at me
and see a weapon.

289
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:22,038
They look at her
and see a whore.

290
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:24,875
They look at me and they see
a misshapen little beast.

291
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,043
Their contempt
is their weakness.

292
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:30,630
They'll underestimate us every time
and we will use that to our advantage.

293
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,800
You will not use them.

294
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,603
They will use you.
That is what they do.

295
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,110
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

296
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,486
( breathing heavily )

297
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,376
You all right?

298
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:02,712
Why don't you sit
and catch your breath?

299
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,749
- I'm fine.
- ( chuckles )

300
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:08,084
I don't think you
could ride the dragon.

301
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,303
20 years ago, maybe.

302
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,672
- What?
- Our queen.

303
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:16,142
She's wild, you know.
Don't let her size fool you.

304
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,979
It's hard enough for me
and I'm a young man.

305
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,849
You, I don't think
your heart could take it.

306
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,022
Must make you angry
that our queen chose me.

307
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:32,275
Makes me sad.
You'll disappoint her before long.

308
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,778
- She'll move on.
- We'll all disappoint her before long.

309
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:37,747
We need each other right now.
After we're done needing each other--

310
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,284
Oh, I don't want to fight you,
Jorah the Andal.

311
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,086
What do I have to gain?

312
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,839
If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

313
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,092
If I lose, I'm the shit
who was killed by an old man.

314
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,964
You didn't get much
discipline as a child, did you?

315
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,799
None.

316
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,558
The road running
through the Horse Gate,

317
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,476
they call that
the godsway.

318
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,279
Eastern Market,
Western Market.

319
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:11,054
When Khal Drogo died,

320
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,278
she was supposed to come here
and join the Dosh Khaleen,

321
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:16,903
the widows
of the dead khals.

322
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,955
That's where they
would have taken her,

323
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,242
<i>the Temple</i>
<i>of the Dosh Khaleen.</i>

324
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:31,835
What are you doing?

325
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,504
It's forbidden to carry weapons
in the sacred city.

326
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,008
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
their city and steal their khaleesi?

327
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:39,976
If they spot us
and we're unarmed,

328
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:42,512
we'll say we're traders heading
for the Western Market.

329
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,264
But if they see
weapons...

330
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,066
You're asking a dog
to hand over his teeth.

331
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:48,184
There's 100,000
of them down there.

332
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,769
We can't fight our way out.

333
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,606
We wait till dark,
and then we'll find her.

334
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:01,281
Uh...

335
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:05,669
I'm very attached
to this knife.

336
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,049
Don't worry.
It didn't touch you.

337
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,636
You know what happens?

338
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,437
I know what happens.

339
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,191
I'll do it myself.

340
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:43,373
-<i> ( drum music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

341
00:22:57,472 --> 00:23:00,423
( moaning )

342
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,426
I should have been
born a Dothraki.

343
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,278
<i>( men speaking Dothraki )</i>

344
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:34,207
- Come on.
- ( continues in Dothraki )

345
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,925
( speaking Dothraki )

346
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,205
( grunting )

347
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,744

-<i> What would you seek out?</i>

my husband, my family.

406
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:59,248
Of course, but for you,
that means seeking out money,

407
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:02,201
finery, power.

408
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:06,122
Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

<i>I'm not maligning you.</i>

410
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:11,127
I sought
those things out, too.

00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,100
<i>My father was a cobbler.</i>

413
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:21,354
He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

414
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,973
He was a simple man
and he made simple shoes.

415
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,477
But I found that the more work
I put into my shoes,

416
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:28,778
the more people
wanted them.

417
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:31,948
Fine leather,
ornamentation,

418
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:35,902
detailing,
and time.

419
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,703
Time most of all.

420
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:40,406
Dozens of hours
spent on a single pair.

421
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,241
Quality takes time.

422
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:44,293
( chuckles )
Yes.

423
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:46,462
I imagine
you've worn a year

424
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:49,499

on your back.

425
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:51,968
<i>The highborn liked to cover</i>
<i>their feet with my time</i>

426
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:55,054
and they paid well
for the privilege.

427
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:56,722
I used their money

428
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:59,559
to buy a taste
of their lives for myself.

429
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:01,811
<i>Each time I indulged,</i>

430
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:06,015
I felt myself ascending
to something better.

431
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:08,101
And one day you walked
through a graveyard

432
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:09,902
and realized it was
all for nothing

433
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:12,522
and set out on the path
to righteousness.

434
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:15,241
Book of the Stranger,
verse 25.

435
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,860
You know
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

436
00:30:17,996 --> 00:30:20,663
Septa Unella reads it to me.
At me.

437
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:24,584
Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

438
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,703
You're close.

439
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,873
But it wasn't
a graveyard.

440
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,792
It was a feast.

441
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:35,178
I bought old fine wine

442
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:37,296
and young pretty girls

443
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:41,100
and invited my friends
to come and share it all.

444
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:44,604
<i>We passed around the wine,</i>
<i>passed around the women,</i>

445
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:47,440
<i>and soon we fell</i>
<i>into a stupor.</i>

446
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:53,529
I woke before dawn.

447
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:56,732
I could barely stand.

448
00:30:56,868 --> 00:31:01,571
Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,

449
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:06,325
lying in heaps next
to their fine clothes.

450
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,878
The truth of their bodies
laid bare.

451
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:13,749
I could smell them

452
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:17,220
beneath the incense
and the perfume

453
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:21,007
and the fine food that had
already started to turn.

454
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:26,345
And I saw it
with perfect clarity.

455
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,765
I saw what my sins were.

456
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,103
The gold I had, the wine I drank,
the women I used,

457
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,441
my ceaseless struggle
to maintain my position.

458
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,364
It was all part
of a story.

459
00:31:47,785 --> 00:31:50,836
A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

460
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,422
<i>A collection of lies</i>

461
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:55,458
<i>that would disappear</i>
<i>in the light.</i>

462
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:59,462
The people I was trying
to climb away from,

463
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:01,047
the beggars
in the street,

464
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:02,682
<i>the poor,</i>

465
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,552
they were closer
to the truth than I ever was.

466
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:09,188
So what did you do?

467
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:11,140
<i>I left to go</i>
<i>and find them.</i>

468
00:32:11,276 --> 00:32:14,860
I didn't even
put on my shoes.

469
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:18,864
I walked out the door
and never went back.

470
00:32:24,622 --> 00:32:26,572
Come, let's go
and see him.

471
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,076
- Who?
- Your brother.

472
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:43,756
<i>( door locks )</i>

473
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:47,426

474
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:55,935
Loras.

475
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,334
( sobbing )

476
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,706
Listen to me.

477
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,674
You need to stay strong.

478
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:24,547
I can't stay strong.

479
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:26,432
I never was strong.

480
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,301
You are strong.

481
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,720
You are the future
of our house,

482
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,221
the future
of our family.

483
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,890
- I don't care about that.
- Shh!

484
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,776
Shh.

485
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:39,145
Have you--
have you told them that?

486
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,730
That you don't care?

487
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:44,817
I just want it to stop.

488
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,071
Help me.

489
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:51,657
( sobbing )

490
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,414
They want me
to help you.

491
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:01,033
They want me to help
tear you down.

492
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,486
They want me to help
tear you down.

493
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:05,556
That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

494
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:09,326
And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

495
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,128
Let them win.

496
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,531
Just make it stop.

497
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,833
Please.

498
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:20,370
- ( sobbing )
- All right.

499

Pycelle: <i>And now, how to avert disaster</i>
<i>with our current predicament.</i>

500
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:31,014
<i>This High Sparrow.</i>

501
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:34,084
<i>I have dealt with fanatics</i>
<i>of every description, Your Grace.</i>

502
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:37,821
Not setting them off,
that's the most important thing.

503
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:41,124
You are beset with enemies
both within and without.

504
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,893
What are you doing here?

505
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,032
I am advising the king
on our current predicament.

506
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,076
Leave.

507
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
I am a member
of the small council.

508
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:53,837
The king--

509
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:56,573
Is this a small
council meeting?

510
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:57,941
Obviously not.

511
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:01,144
I'm here to lend my wisdom
and my support.

512
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:04,481
Thank you for your counsel,
Grand Maester.

513
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,483
That will be all
for now.

514
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:08,352
Your Grace.

515
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:35,679
Since I've missed
the past several small council meetings,

516
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,548
I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

517
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,552
I've been thinking
about the High Sparrow.

518
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,322
As have we all,
unfortunately.

519
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:48,325
We need to be careful
in dealing with such a man.

520
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,229
To prevent things from
escalating any further.

521
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:56,600
We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

522
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,102
He has Margaery.
We can't put her at risk.

523
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:01,938
- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

524
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,874
What did they do to me?

525
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,909
To the king's own mother?

526
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:13,116
It's all right.

527
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:15,652
It's done.
It's in the past.

528
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,988
And of course

529
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,791
Margaery's safety
is paramount.

530
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,029
You don't like Margaery,
do you?

531
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:30,867
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

532
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:34,938
Margaery is the queen.

533
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,643
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

534
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:42,546
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

535
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:47,951
The High Sparrow has no respect for
kings or queens.

536
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,886
No respect for anything
in this world.

537
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:52,889
He has no use
for the things of this world.

538
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,626
He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?

539
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,829
With fantasies.

540
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,931
<i>With beggars</i>
<i>in the street.</i>

541
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:02,232
With nothing.

542
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,802
Mother...

543
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,072
there's something
I want to tell you.

544
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,843
Something the High
Sparrow told me.

545
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:17,347
You've spoken with him?

546
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:22,753
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told--

547
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,655
It would be a breach of confidence which
he would not take lightly

548
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:28,525
given his constant
prattling about the truth.

549
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:34,164
I am your mother.

550
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,234
You can always trust me.

551
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:45,108
<i>( door opens )</i>

552
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:48,612
The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.

553
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:51,073
I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.

554
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:52,345
<i>You're not welcome.</i>

555
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:54,317
<i>You once spoke of your</i>
<i>respect for our father</i>

556
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:57,053
because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.

557
00:37:57,155 --> 00:38:01,958
My dear, you have been stripped of your
dignity and authority,

558
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:05,061
publically shamed,
and confined to the Red Keep.

559
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,397
( chuckles )
What's left to work with?

560
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:09,900
Jaime: <i>Cersei is the mother</i>
<i>of the king.</i>

561
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,702
She has the king's ear
and his trust.

562
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:14,738
And the king has been
speaking regularly

563
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:18,241
with the High Sparrow
about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

564
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:19,976
The High Sparrow
seized power

565
00:38:20,077 --> 00:38:22,045
knowing full well
we'd bicker amongst ourselves

566
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:23,847
instead of
seizing it back.

567
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,749
Here we are.
Well done to us.

568
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,951
Now the future
of the Seven Kingdoms

569
00:38:28,052 --> 00:38:29,886
rests in his dirty
peasant hands.

570
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:32,756
In a few days, he'll have
a trial for me.

571
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:36,426
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

572
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:40,130
Yes, Margaery
will repent her sins

573
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,199
before the good people
of the city.

574
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,768
Oh, no.

575
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:47,671
That cannot happen.

576
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,573
That will not happen.

577
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:51,341
I agree.

578
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,880
You've got the second largest
army in Westeros.

579
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:58,415
You'll bring them
into the city,

580
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:01,184
stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

581
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:03,687
and take her back
into Crown custody.

582
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:07,524
The king has ordered me to take
no action against the High Sparrow

583
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:10,727
or the Faith Militant out of fear
for the queen's safety.

584
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:12,662
You will take
no action at all.

585
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:15,298
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

586
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:19,069
<i>Are you expressly</i>
<i>forbidden from standing down?</i>

587
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,038
No, but if the king
should call--

588
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:24,908
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

589
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:29,145
When the High Sparrow is in custody
or dead, preferably,

590
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,781
and Margaery's back
at Tommen's side,

591
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:33,984
do you think the king
will be angry at the outcome?

592
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,820
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

593
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:40,190
You hate what
they've done to your son.

594
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:42,158
Do you want Lancel back?

595
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,127
Or have you
given him up for good?

596
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,164
Of course
I want him back.

597
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:53,169
Then stand aside

598
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,473
and let the people
that took him from you be destroyed.

599
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,845
If it doesn't
go as planned,

600
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,314
the sparrows have
many friends in this city.

601
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:07,150
We'll have civil war.
Many will die.

602
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,653
Many will die
no matter what we do.

603
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,156
Better them than us.

604
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:36,313
( chatter )

605
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:54,831
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

606
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,948
They told me you were home
and I didn't believe it.

607
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,753
"Theon Greyjoy?"
I said.

608
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:19,189
"He's dead.

609
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,658
He's been dead
a long time."

610
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:26,763
He let you go?

611
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,331
I escaped.

612
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,702
I can't hear you.

613
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:34,471
I escaped.

614
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:38,575
Look at me.

615
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,651
Look at me.

616
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:52,756
Men died trying
to rescue you.

617
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,457
Good men.

618
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:56,026
My men.

619
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:59,129
I'm sorry.

620
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,264
You were my brother.

621
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:04,401
You were a spoiled little cunt,
but you were my brother

622
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:06,469
and I risked
everything for you

623
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,937
and you betrayed me.

624
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:10,206
I know.
I know and I'm sorry.

625
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:11,608
Stop saying that.

626
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:13,910
He broke me.

627
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:16,713
He broke me
into 1,000 pieces.

628
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,181
- I know.
- You don't know.

629
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:20,784
He sent us
one of those pieces.

630
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:22,852
That's why
I came for you.

631
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:27,557
( sobbing )

632
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:30,794
Why did you come here?

633
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:32,495
Where else could I go?

634
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:36,299
You heard Father was dead and you thought
you'd claim the crown?

635
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,368
No, no. I only heard he died
after we docked.

636
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:41,371
You happen to show up
on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?

637
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:42,939
I didn't know.

638
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:49,145
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

639
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:51,047
after what you've done?

640
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:53,116
I don't want
to be king.

641
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:56,453
What do you want?

642
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:58,594
I should have listened to you.
You're the only one--

643
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,024
That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

644
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,126
Look at me.

645
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:06,396
Tell me what you want.

646
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:13,436
You should rule
the Iron Islands.

647
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,673
Let me help you.

648
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,502
They've cleaned
you up nicely.

649
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,506
You know who I am?

650
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:52,308
A lord.

651
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:54,344
Yes.

652
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:57,013
A lord.

653
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:59,048
You've seen my banners?

654
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:02,519
The flayed man.

655
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,455
Does that worry
you at all?

656
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:07,056
You eat them after?

657
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:10,627
( chuckles )

658
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:11,961
No.

659
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:15,064
( scoffs )
Then I've seen worse.

660
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:41,257
You served the Starks?

661
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:43,893
Aye.
They put me in chains

662
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:45,862
and put a sword
at my throat,

663
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:47,230
so I served them.

664
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:50,700
The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

665
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:53,570
but you kept
protecting Rickon.

666
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:57,173
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

667
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:59,042
I served his family
a long time.

668
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:01,277
Didn't get no wages.

669
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:04,514
Way I see it,
I'm owed.

670
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,252
Be that as it may,

671
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:11,821
Rickon's not yours
to sell anymore.

672
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:13,590
He's mine.

673
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,726
So what use could I possibly
have for you?

674
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:19,028
( scoffs )

675
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:21,464
I can give you
what you want.

676
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,800
And you're sure
you know what that is?

677
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:28,905
Same thing
men always want.

678
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:33,209
And when they really want it,
they give it a bath first.

679
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:38,781
( moans )

680
00:45:41,518 --> 00:45:43,786
You're a good talker.

681
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:47,924
I like that.

682
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:59,235
You're a much better talker
than Theon Greyjoy.

683
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,438
That so?

684
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:04,841
I had to work hard
to get him talking.

685
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:07,443
But he talked.

686
00:46:07,544 --> 00:46:09,212
They all do.

687
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:12,081
He told me everything.

688
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:15,018
All about the Stark boys,

689
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,353
who helped them escape,

690
00:46:17,454 --> 00:46:18,788
and how she did it.

691
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,968
( sighs )

692
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,152
Man:
<i>Open the gate!</i>

693
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:38,234
Sorry about the food.

694
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:40,370
It's not what
we're known for.

695
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:42,939
That's all right.
There are more important things.

696
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,308
<i>( door opens )</i>

697
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:49,779
A letter for you,
Lord Commander.

698
00:47:51,582 --> 00:47:53,483
I'm not Lord
Commander anymore.

699
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:15,972
"To the traitor
and bastard Jon Snow.

700
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:19,308
You allowed thousands
of wildlings past the Wall.

701
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,877
You have betrayed
your own kind.

702
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,845
You have betrayed
the North.

703
00:48:22,946 --> 00:48:26,082
Winterfell is mine, bastard.
Come and see.

Your brother Rickon

His direwolf's skin
is on my floor.

00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:43,223
Come and see.
I want my bride back.

707
00:48:43,224 --> 00:48:44,507
Send her to me, bastard,

708
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:46,803
and I will not trouble you
or your wildling lovers.

709
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:49,906
Keep her from me
and I will ride north and slaughter

710
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:53,509
every wildling man, woman,
and babe living under your protection.

711
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,257
You will watch
as I skin them living.

712
00:48:56,281 --> 00:48:58,281
You--"

713
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,017
Go on.

714
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:02,919
It's just more
of the same.

715
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:11,394
"You will watch as my soldiers
take turns raping your sister.

716
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:14,197
<i>You will watch</i>
<i>as my dogs</i>

717
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:16,899
devour your wild
little brother.

718
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:22,538
Then I will spoon your eyes from their
sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

719
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,576
Come and see.
Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell

720
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:28,411
and Warden of the North."

721
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:35,852
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

722
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:38,855
His father's dead.

723
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:40,490
Ramsay killed him.

724
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:42,959
- <i>And now he has Rickon.</i>
<i>- We don't know that.</i>

725
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,461
Yes, we do.

726
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:48,064
How many men does
he have in his army?

727
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:51,576
I heard him say 5,000

728
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,612
once when he was talking
about Stannis's attack.

729
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:56,339
How many do you have?

730
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,375
That can march and fight?

731
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:01,210
2,000.

732
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:05,214
The rest are children
and old people.

733
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,855
You're the son of the last
true Warden of the North.

734
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:16,592
Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

735
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:22,932
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

736
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:27,370
We have to go back
to Winterfell and save them both.
